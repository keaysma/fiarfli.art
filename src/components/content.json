{"about":"Hi, I'm Raquel!\n\nI'm a multimedia illustrator, animator, and comic artist.\n\nI love using whimsical color pallets and am inspired by biology, fantasy novels, fun video games, and my experiences as someone who fits in in many places and none at the same time. I'm still looking for my niche, but I'd love to work in vis dev or character design.\n\nI often work with digital and traditional materials; my traditional tools of choice are colored pencils, markers, and watercolor, and my digital tool box consists of programs such as Clip Studio Paint, Blender, and various programs from the Adobe Suite!\n\nI want to continue improving my animation skills, and maybe even have my own animation studio in the future.\n\n","commissions":"       I am \n                           ~ OPEN ~\n                °˖✧✨◝(⁰▿⁰)◜✨✧˖°   for commissions!\n\nAll information on my slots for (digital)\n\n     ✎Sketches\n           ✎Illustrations\n                 ✎Short Animations \n\n                           is available on my ko-fi: \n\n                                  https://ko-fi.com/fiarfli/commissions\n                                                                                 ♪(^∇^*)\n             Please contact me below if you have any questions or requests!\n","contact":"Got more questions about commissions?\nMaybe just want to say hi?\nPlease feel free to reach out!\n\nThanks! o(≧▽≦)o🎉","contactFormEnabled":true}
