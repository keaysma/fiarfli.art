  "about": "Hi, I'm Raquel! I'm a Colombian-American artist. I use digital and traditional materials; my traditional tools of choice are colored pencils, markers, and watercolor, and my digital tool box consists of programs such as Clip Studio Paint, Blender, and various programs from the Adobe Suite! I grew up just outside of DC in Northern Virginia. I'm currently living in New York City with my partner and our stinky critter larping as a dog.\n",
